## PyNN: A numpy based neural network library for quick prototyping

### What is PyNN? 
PyNN is a library that allows you to prototype your neural network architecture and monito it's performance.PyNN is built on numpy library and has a light core. 

### How do I use it? 
Setting up a training is simple, you define your model using existing layers and define the backward pass. Then you instantiate a Solver object and just call 'train' to begin training. 

### But this has only a few layers
I'll be updating the code routinely to add more and more layers. Development may be slow since I'm making it in my spare time, but
